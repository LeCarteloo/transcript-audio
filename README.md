This template repository is designed to help developers quickly set up a front-end project with a modern tech stack. It includes Vite, a build tool that enables fast development and hot module replacement, **React**, a popular and powerful front-end library, and **Typescript**, a typed superset of **JavaScript** that helps catch errors at compile-time.

In addition, the repository comes with several tools to ensure code quality and maintainability, such as **Eslint**, which provides a comprehensive set of rules for linting **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** code, **Stylelint**, which helps maintain consistent and error-free stylesheets, and **Prettier**, a code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.

To facilitate testing, the template includes **Jest**, a powerful testing framework for **JavaScript**, and **React-Testing-Library**, a lightweight testing utility that helps write maintainable tests. For end-to-end testing, the repository also includes **Playwright**, a  library for automating browsers and testing web applications.

Finally, to aid in documentation and UI development, the template comes with **StoryBook**, a tool for developing UI components in isolation, and React-Router, a popular routing library for React applications. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive set of features for building robust, high-quality front-end projects.
